# how it's made

this site is made with Astro, for easy separation and markdown for when I add a blog to the site and Tailwind because Tailwind. I've also styled Tailwind with the Catppuccin Mocha color pallette, my favourite scheme. The virtual business card is made with vanilla-tilt, a very nice tilt library, and a text hover effect from Hyperplexed.
